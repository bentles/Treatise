@article{EfficientInterpreters,
  abstract = {Interpreters designed for high general-purpose performance typically perform a large
number of indirect branches (3.2%-13% of all executed instructions in our benchmarks).
These branches consume more than half of the run-time in a number of congurations
we simulated. We evaluate how accurate various existing and proposed branch prediction
schemes are on a number of interpreters, how the mispredictions aect the performance of
the interpreters and how two dierent interpreter implementation techniques perform with
various branch predictors. We also suggest various ways in which hardware designers, C
compiler writers, and interpreter writers can improve the performance of interpreters.},
